# Simple-Grammar-Analyzer
Spring 2015, CS311, Simple Grammar Analyzer


This program was written using Ruby version 2.1.5p273. Other versions may cause it to break, so please use the correct version. (note, the linux servers are using v1.9.3) If you're running this on unix/linux/mac, I think you can simply type 

./grammar_analyzer.rb 

to run the program. Any other system may require you to type 

ruby grammar_analyzer.rb

You can use the latter in all cases. The file IO may break on a windows machine (though I hope not). I don't have access to one to test it out.
