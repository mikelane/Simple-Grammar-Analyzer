Other versions may cause it to break, so please use the correct version. (note, the linux servers are using v1.9.3) If you're running this on unix/linux/mac, I think you can simply type \r\n\r\n./grammar_analyzer.rb \r\n\r\nto run the program. Any other system may require you to type \r\n\r\nruby grammar_analyzer.rb\r\n\r\nYou can use the latter in all cases. The file IO may break on a windows machine (though I hope not). I don't have access to one to test it out.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file! It's used internally to help with page regeneration."}
